description: Understand which browsers and Node.js versions Dinero.js supports and how to manage polyfills.
---

## Browser support

Dinero.js supports the last two versions of major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari).

To support Internet Explorer 11, you can use [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/). Add the following script to your page to conditionally load polyfills.

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default%2CMath.trunc%2CMath.sign%2CNumber.isInteger%2CString.prototype.padEnd"></script>
```

Note that the code samples used in this documentation can use JavaScript syntax not natively supported by older browsers like Internet Explorer 11. If your site supports older browsers, make sure to use a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transform your code into code that works in the browsers you target.

## Node.js

Dinero.js runs on any [active or maintenance LTS version](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/) of Node.js.
