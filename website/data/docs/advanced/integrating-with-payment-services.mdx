One of the most common use case when manipulating money is payment.

## Integrating with Stripe

The [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment platform provides APIs to process payments and manage orders. Like many other platforms, it expects [money representations](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal) with an amount in minor currency units, and a currency as an ISO 4217 currency code.

When using Stripe's Node.js client, [the currency must be in lowercase](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/create?lang=node#create_charge-currency).

```js
import stripe from 'stripe';
import { dinero, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

function toStripeMoney(dineroObject) {
  const { amount, currency } = toSnapshot(dineroObject);

  return { amount, currency: currency.code.toLowerCase() };
}

// ...

const price = dinero({ amount: 2000, currency: USD });

const charge = await client.charges.create(toStripeMoney(price));
```

## Integrating with Adyen

The [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/) payment platform provides APIs to process payments and manage orders. Like many other platforms, it expects [money representations](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/Money) with an amount in minor currency units, and a currency as an ISO 4217 currency code.

```js
import { Client, Config, CheckoutAPI } from '@adyen/api-library';
import { dinero, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

function toAdyenMoney(dineroObject) {
  const { amount, currency } = toSnapshot(dineroObject);

  return { value: amount, currency: currency.code };
};

// ...

const price = dinero({ amount: 2000, currency: USD });

const paymentsResponse = await checkout.paymentMethods({
  // ...
  amount: toAdyenMoney(price),
});
```

## Integrating with Square

The [Square](https://squareup.com/) digital payment platform provides APIs to process payments and manage orders. Like many other platforms, it expects [money representations](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/currency-codes) with an amount in minor currency units, and a currency as an ISO 4217 currency code.

When using Square's Node.js client, [the amount must be of type `bigint`](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/src/models/money.ts). If you're using Dinero.js with the `number` calculator (default behavior), you can cast the amount into a `bigint` when transforming your Dinero object into a Square `Money` object. Otherwise, if you're using Dinero with the `bigint` calculator, you can pass the amount directly.

```js
import { Client } from 'square';
import { dinero, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

function toSquareMoney(dineroObject) {
  const { amount, currency } = toSnapshot(dineroObject);

  return { amount: BigInt(amount), currency: currency.code };
}

// ...

const price = dinero({ amount: 2000, currency: USD });

const response = await client.paymentsApi.createPayment({
  // ...
  amountMoney: toSquareMoney(price),
});
```
