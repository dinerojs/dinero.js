title: How can I create Dinero objects from floats?
description: How to instantiate Dinero objects with float inputs using your own factory.
---

Dinero objects must be instantiated with integers, in minor currency units. For example, to create an object for $19.99, you should write the following code:

```js
import { dinero, add, subtract } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies-number';

const d = dinero({ amount: 1999, currency: USD });
```

If you have amounts as floats (in this case, `19.99`) and you want to abstract object creation, you can write your own helper.

```js
function dineroFromFloat({ amount: float, currency, scale }) {
  const factor = currency.base ** currency.exponent || scale;
  const amount = Math.round(float * factor);

  return dinero({ amount, currency, scale });
}
```
