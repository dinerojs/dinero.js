 * Divide and round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are
 * equidistant, in which case round up.
 *
 * Rounding up happens when:
 * - The quotient is half (e.g., -1.5, 1.5).
 * - The quotient is positive and greater than half (e.g., 1.6).
 * - The quotient is negative and less than half (e.g., -1.4).
 *
 * @param amount - The amount to divide.
 * @param factor - The factor to divide by.
 * @param calculator - The calculator to use.
 *
 * @returns The rounded amount.
