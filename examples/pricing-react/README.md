- Multiplying amounts with `multiply` for per-seat pricing
- Computing discounts with `allocate` for precise ratio-based distribution
- Subtracting amounts with `subtract` for discounted prices
- Checking values with `isZero` and `hasSubUnits` for display logic
- Formatting money for display with `toDecimal`
